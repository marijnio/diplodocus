    **Basic rice**
    
    1. Wash the rice three times with your hands and a sieve in a bowl of water.
    2. Drain the rice for the last time and let it stand (preferably 30 minutes).
    3. Put the rice in a pan with the measured water and let it soak for at least 30 minutes, but not more than 8 hours.
    4. Put the pan on high heat and let it boil for a minute. You can stir to spread the heat.
    5. Let the pan boil over medium heat until the water has reached the surface of the rice. That can take a few minutes.
    6. Let the pan boil for another 10 minutes on a low heat. Do not cheat under the lid! It's okay if some rice will stick to the bottom.
    7. Remove the pan from the heat and cover with a clean tea towel for 10-15 minutes so that the excess moisture disappears. Very important.
    8. Carefully transfer the rice to a bowl with a plastic or wooden spoon and cover again with a tea towel. Leave any rice stuck to the bottom. Use or continue to make sushi rice.

    **Sushi rice**

    1. Mix the ingredients for the dressing in a microwave-safe dish.
    2. Heat briefly and stir to dissolve the sugar and salt.
    3. Mix the dressing into the hot rice while stirring gently.
    4. Use the rice while it is still warm.

In Japan, rice is seen as the most important ingredient of the meal. Everything else - fish, meat or vegetables - is just a supplement to the rice. The same applies to sushi. The rice is considered the most important part. This is my go-to recipe for the fundamental ingredient of Japanese cuisine.

This recipe is largely taken from [Just Hungry](https://justhungry.com/japanese-basics-plain-rice-sushi-rice). I have translated and simplified the ingredients and steps. The ratio that they maintain is 1: 1.25 rice per water. This amounts to 625 ml of water per 500 grams of dry, Japanese rice. With the water I mean the balanced water that you add in step 3.
